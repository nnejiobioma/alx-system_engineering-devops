Root Cause: The root cause of the incident was a technician mistakenly deleted a file from the life server during clean up at the end of the day thinking that he is still working on the test file. And this resulted in inability of users to access the intrant.

Impact: The outage affected all users who were attempting to access the intranet during the downtime for various activity.

Resolution: To prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, the following steps can be taken:

Ensure that all technicians work on the test server first, confirm that all is working well before they apply the fix to the life server.
Ensure that all services are tested before the close of work.
Services should be tested at intervals during implementation and troubleshooting. This will ensure that failure of services isnoticed on time.
